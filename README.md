Chapter highlights

Chapter One - Character 

Day 1: See yourself as an economic product on the open market

"This means when you are chosen to take a position at a company, your boss is literally betting their own career and livelihood on your performance."
"The key to moving ahead is to become the very best investment possible."
"Everybody chases a good investment and divests themselves of bad investments. Consider that a natural law."
"If you are an investment that gets a return, you will attract business, responsibilities, and greter compensation."
"Successful business leaders conduct their lives so they are terrific financial investments. You should conduct your life that way too."

Day 2: See yourself as a hero, not a victim.

Day 3: Know how to de-escalate drama.

"Dramatic peopler, however, steal your energy so you don't have anything left to take care of yourself or others."
"We respect people who react a little under, not over, the lever of drama a situation deserves. We trust people who can remain calmand de-escalate drama so that crucial energy needed to deal with a truly important situation is not wasted."
"When tasked with something monumental, being a dramatic person will not serve your interests."

Day 4: Accept Feedback as a Gift

"Many of the worl's most successful people have established a routine in which they get feedback from their peers."
To establish a feeback loop in your life, consider these ideas:
"1. Choose people who have your best interest at heart."
"2. Schedule meetings in a repeting routine-every quarter or every month."
"3. Establish a routine set of questions."
"Have you seen me act unprofessionally?"
"Have you noticed that I've been missing something?"
"What am I doing that I can improve upon?"
"Very few people have the ability to hear and accept feedback."

Day 5: Know the Right Way to Engage in Conflict

"Conflict avoidant people are rarely chosen to lead."
"You cannot climb a mountain, build a bridge, create a community, or grow a business without engaging in and navigating conflict."
"...conflict and success go hand in hand. If you avoid conflict, your will not achieve success."

Day 6: Long to be Trusted and Respected More Than Liked

"What team members want most is clarity."
"Many new managers are confused at how relationships with peers change when they are chosen to lead."
"When you ask a team member what their boss expects of them, the team member should know;..."
"Let them know and keep them accountable in a daily stand up meeting."
"Do not put your team in the mind reading business. Even if they clearly meet your expectations, they won't beleive it until you tell them."

Day 7: Have a Bias toward Action

"...becoming successful is more about fully being yourself than it is about any kind of formula."
"That said, there is one thing every successful person has in common: They have a bias toward action."
"getting the ball in the end zone"
:We say this because we know drawing up plays, giving pep talks, and even the hard work of driving the ball down the field does not produce points. The only thing that produces points is putting the ball in the end zone."
"In fact, it's surprising to me how many successful people I've met who I did not find to be especialy intelligent. That is, as I've talked with them, I realised they were not well read or imaginative. And as I've wondered how such simple thinkers could end up with so much influence and money, I've realised it'vs because their incredibly strong bias towards action."
"...know that you can beat just about anybody in the marketplace as long as you wake up everyday and take action."

Day 8: Do Not Choose to Be Confused

"What masquerades as confusion is often our desire to avoid conflict and out unwillingness to take action."
"We just don't want to do the thing we need to do, and so we choose confusion to avoid responsibility."
"It helps me in times of confusion to actually name what it is that is making us confused."

Day 9" Be Relentlessly Optimistic

Day 10: Have a Growth Mindset

Why do they become defensive? Because they do not beleive they can learn to do better.
In short, having a growth mindset is about understanding that we will never reach the top of the mountain but we can keep climbing so the view gets better and better. 

Chapter 2: Leadership Made Simple

The number one job of a leader is to wake up every morning, point to the horizon , and let everybody on the team know where the organization is going.
Great leaders become great because their mission makes them great.
A leader who can help a team define a mission and who can remind that team daily of what the mission is and why it matters is a valuable gift to their organization. 

Day 11: Write a Good Mission Statement

To lead yourself of a team, you have to know where you're going. 
A good mission statement is short, interesting and inspirational. Otherwise, it's worthless. 
It should explain what you are doing to serve people and why that effort matters.
People are attracted to a mission. They aren't attracted to business jargon.
Here is a formula for a good mission statement: We will accomplish _____ by _____ because of _____ .
The reality is, if we or our team cannot recite our mission statement, we are not on a mission.

Day 12: Define Key Characteristics

When I say inspirational, I mean they don't have to be characteristics you currently embody. They can be characteristics they demand improvement and change. And when I say instructive, What I mena is they should be immediatley actionable when sombody hears them. 
When you define the key characteristics your team needs to develop, you're defining the kinds of people who are aloud to work for you. 
Defining key characteristics helps you know which people to hire and which people to dismiss. If you fail to define the key characteristics required to accomplish yourmission, your will likley have the wrong people on your team. 
What sort of characteristics is it important for you and your team members to have in order to accomplish your mission?

Day 13: Determine Critical Actions
But unless characters in stories do something, the mission will never be accomplished. 
...but by defining three critical actions everyone of you can take, ou create a sense of alignment you wouldn't otherwise have. 
...you collect and focus energy toward the accomplishment of your mission. 
Those three critical actions establish a way of life

Day 14: Tell a Great Story

Telling the story of your company or project is important because in telling your story your attract resources. When you tell your story, people decide whether or not to buy from you, or even spread the word about what you're doing. 
Often, they make the mistake of telling their history. 
But your history is not your story. Your story is different. Your story is way of explaining what you do that engaged people and makes them want to join. Your history, on the other hand, is just a bunch of things that has happened in your past. 
In the most simple form a story structure, a story features a character who has been destabilized by an event ands then overcomes a series of challenges to restabilize their life.
We started with a problem, made the problem worse, positioned the product as the resolution to the problem, and then described a happier life because the problem has been solved. 
Telling stories isn't hard. It just takes a little knowledge and then the discipline to stay on message. 
What problem does your company solve? How is that problem making people feel? How is your product positioned to solve that problem? And after the problem is solved, what do people lives look like?
...make sure each team member knows how to tell the story...
