# Business-Made-Simple-By-Donald-Miller
Chapter highlights

Chapter One - Character 

Day 1: See yourself as an economic product on the open market

"This means when you are chosen to take a position at a company, your boss is literally betting their own career and livelihood on your performance."
"The key to moving ahead is to become the very best investment possible."
"Everybody chases a good investment and divests themselves of bad investments. Consider that a natural law."
"If you are an investment that gets a return, you will attract business, responsibilities, and greter compensation."
"Successful business leaders conduct their lives so they are terrific financial investments. You should conduct your life that way too."

Day 2: See yourself as a hero, not a victim.

Day 3: Know how to de-escalate drama.

"Dramatic peopler, however, steal your energy so you don't have anything left to take care of yourself or others."
"We respect people who react a little under, not over, the lever of drama a situation deserves. We trust people who can remain calmand de-escalate drama so that crucial energy needed to deal with a truly important situation is not wasted."
"When tasked with something monumental, being a dramatic person will not serve your interests."

Day 4: Accept Feedback as a Gift

"Many of the worl's most successful people have established a routine in which they get feedback from their peers."
To establish a feeback loop in your life, consider these ideas:
"1. Choose people who have your best interest at heart."
"2. Schedule meetings in a repeting routine-every quarter or every month."
"3. Establish a routine set of questions."
"Have you seen me act unprofessionally?"
"Have you noticed that I've been missing something?"
"What am I doing that I can improve upon?"
"Very few people have the ability to hear and accept feedback."

Day 5: Know the Right Way to Engage in Conflict

"Conflict avoidant people are rarely chosen to lead."
"You cannot climb a mountain, build a bridge, create a community, or grow a business without engaging in and navigating conflict."
"...conflict and success go hand in hand. If you avoid conflict, your will not achieve success."

Day 6: Long to be Trusted and Respected More Than Liked

"What team members want most is clarity."
"Many new managers are confused at how relationships with peers change when they are chosen to lead."
"When you ask a team member what their boss expects of them, the team member should know;..."
"Let them know and keep them accountable in a daily stand up meeting."
"Do not put your team in the mind reading business. Even if they clearly meet your expectations, they won't beleive it until you tell them."

Day 7: Have a Bias toward Action

"...becoming successful is more about fully being yourself than it is about any kind of formula."
"That said, there is one thing every successful person has in common: They have a bias toward action."
"getting the ball in the end zone"
:We say this because we know drawing up plays, giving pep talks, and even the hard work of driving the ball down the field does not produce points. The only thing that produces points is putting the ball in the end zone."
"In fact, it's surprising to me how many successful people I've met who I did not find to be especialy intelligent. That is, as I've talked with them, I realised they were not well read or imaginative. And as I've wondered how such simple thinkers could end up with so much influence and money, I've realised it'vs because their incredibly strong bias towards action."
"...know that you can beat just about anybody in the marketplace as long as you wake up everyday and take action."

Day 8: Do Not Choose to Be Confused

"What masquerades as confusion is often our desire to avoid conflict and out unwillingness to take action."
"We just don't want to do the thing we need to do, and so we choose confusion to avoid responsibility."
"It helps me in times of confusion to actually name what it is that is making us confused."

Day 9" Be Relentlessly Optimistic

Day 10: Have a Growth Mindset

Why do they become defensive? Because they do not beleive they can learn to do better.
In short, having a growth mindset is about understanding that we will never reach the top of the mountain but we can keep climbing so the view gets better and better. 

Chapter 2: Leadership Made Simple

The number one job of a leader is to wake up every morning, point to the horizon , and let everybody on the team know where the organization is going.
Great leaders become great because their mission makes them great.
A leader who can help a team define a mission and who can remind that team daily of what the mission is and why it matters is a valuable gift to their organization. 

Day 11: Write a Good Mission Statement

To lead yourself of a team, you have to know where you're going. 
A good mission statement is short, interesting and inspirational. Otherwise, it's worthless. 
It should explain what you are doing to serve people and why that effort matters.
People are attracted to a mission. They aren't attracted to business jargon.
Here is a formula for a good mission statement: We will accomplish _____ by _____ because of _____ .
The reality is, if we or our team cannot recite our mission statement, we are not on a mission.

Day 12: Define Key Characteristics

When I say inspirational, I mean they don't have to be characteristics you currently embody. They can be characteristics they demand improvement and change. And when I say instructive, What I mena is they should be immediatley actionable when sombody hears them. 
When you define the key characteristics your team needs to develop, you're defining the kinds of people who are aloud to work for you. 
Defining key characteristics helps you know which people to hire and which people to dismiss. If you fail to define the key characteristics required to accomplish yourmission, your will likley have the wrong people on your team. 
What sort of characteristics is it important for you and your team members to have in order to accomplish your mission?

Day 13: Determine Critical Actions
But unless characters in stories do something, the mission will never be accomplished. 
...but by defining three critical actions everyone of you can take, ou create a sense of alignment you wouldn't otherwise have. 
...you collect and focus energy toward the accomplishment of your mission. 
Those three critical actions establish a way of life

Day 14: Tell a Great Story

Telling the story of your company or project is important because in telling your story your attract resources. When you tell your story, people decide whether or not to buy from you, or even spread the word about what you're doing. 
Often, they make the mistake of telling their history. 
But your history is not your story. Your story is different. Your story is way of explaining what you do that engaged people and makes them want to join. Your history, on the other hand, is just a bunch of things that has happened in your past. 
In the most simple form a story structure, a story features a character who has been destabilized by an event ands then overcomes a series of challenges to restabilize their life.
We started with a problem, made the problem worse, positioned the product as the resolution to the problem, and then described a happier life because the problem has been solved. 
Telling stories isn't hard. It just takes a little knowledge and then the discipline to stay on message. 
What problem does your company solve? How is that problem making people feel? How is your product positioned to solve that problem? And after the problem is solved, what do people lives look like?
...make sure each team member knows how to tell the story...

Day 15: Define Your Theme and Your "Why"

How do we convince people our mission matters? We do this by defining a theme. 
When a writer defines a themes,  their story gets more meaningful and more clear. If we want our mission to be meaningful and clear, we must have a theme. 
When you define your theme, you and everyone else will know why your mission matters.
...add the word 'because' at the end of your mission statement, and then finish the sentence. 
Knowing your theme becomes important because it is the critical soud bite that answers the question why.
Your theme is your purpose, and people need a purpose to passionately engage in their work. 

Chapter 3: Productivity Made Simple

Many professionals work hard but get little done. Their frantic activity only serves to move them around in circles. There is one reason for this and its that their life lacks focus. 
...human being's life has the most menaing when they live it as though they are a hero on a mission.
A hero on a mission lives with a purpose and intention. They do not waste their time because their time is important. A hero on a mission knows how to manage their time so they do not feel anxious but are focused, motivated, and inspired to do the work that matters. 
If we don't establish priorities and healthy routines, telivision, news, food, achohol, and bad company are more than willing to occupy our time. Plenty of peple make plenty of money by keeping us distracted. But their distractions profit you nothing. 
...learn a daily routine that increases your output without increasing your anxiety.

Day 16: Make Wise Daily Decisions

If this were the second time I were living this day, what would I do differently?
Pretend this is the second time you lived this day and don't make the same mistakes.
...we need to live in such a way that we don't have regret. 
It's by reflecting that we edit our actions and design our lives. 
Are you desinging your life, or is somebody else designing it for you?

Day 17: Prioritize Your Primary Tasks

What's the most important thing you can do today?
...not every unit of work gets the same return.
...two task lists each day...
... three items are the most important tasks for the success of your important objectives. 
The other task list will be the odds and ends that need to be accomplished. 
Most of my prioritized tasks are small parts of much larger projects. 
When working on enormous projects that we cannot finish in a short period of time, we are especially suseptible to short-term wins. I'd much rather return 10 emails than write ten paragraphs in a book because each email makes me feel like I've accomplished something while those ten paragraphs feel like a drop in the bucket. 
...urgent distractions...
Every day, we must know what our three highest return opportunitiesa are, or else low opportuntiy returns will feel more important. 
Any work that moves us closer to our objectives is a high-return opportunity, and any work that does not is not. 
Prioritize those taks, day after day, and you will move closer to your goals without falling into the trap of "urgent distractions".

Day 18: Maximize Your "Power Hours"

The mental energy you have in the morning is stronger and more alert then the energy you'll have after lunch.
...if you block time for your important project in the morning, you'll get to spend the rest of the day knowing you've already completed the important tasks. 
Most value-driven professionals get their important work done in the mornings. 

Day 19: Say "No" to Distractions

They've said yes to so many things tht they've become confused about what their story is about. 
Heroes on a mission, however, are focused. 
There are friends who want to get together and opportunities that, while not in line with our goals, are truly exciting. 
But what if we say yes to too many thing, we are saying no to the deep and focused attention it takes to do a few things well. 
Few people realize that one of the keys to Stephen King's success is his disciplined ability to reject distracting opportunities in exchange for accomplishing his priorities.
If we don't know what our priorities are, we will say yes to everything and delude our stories so much that our lives and work no longer make sense. 
What are you saying no to in order to say yes to a focused and meaningful life?

Day 20: Block Your Time and Get More Done:

Time is worth much more than money.
Sadly, most people don't give much thought to managing their time. That doesn't mena their time isn't managed.
We would never let other people manage the money in our wallet, so why would we let other people manage out time-which, as pointed out, is worth so much more than money.
Blocking periods of time in which you cannot be distracted is the equivalent of getting into the fast lane and pressing the gas pedal.
Your entire career is based on increasing output as it relates to your activity. A value-driven professional can get twice as much done in the same period of time as a professional who does not use time strategically.
Blocking my time in advance allows me to say no to distractions because, well, I'm already booked. 
The idea is to create a rhythm of productivity.
What important tasks do you need to do each week?Consider assigning those taks to a specific block of time you decide in advance. 
...block personal time so you don't accidentally book a business meeting during the time block yuou've allotted for friends and family. 

Chapter 4: How a Business Really Works and How to Keep It From Crashing

Day 22: Keep Your Overhead Down

And cash flow seems to always hit zero suddenly. Nobody seems to see it coming. 
Overhead is anyting involved in the cost of doing business tht is not releated to product creation, marketing, or sales. 
Unless money is spent in the direct effort to make more money, that expenditure should be questioned. This is the key to keeping overhead in check. 
Categorize your expenses into four major categories: product creation, sales, marketing and overhead. 

Day 23: Mane and Sell the Right Products

They are light. They can be sold for considerable profit or a smaller profit but at volume.
They are strong. There is a strong demand for the product in the marketplace.
...we wil only invest in products that are profitable and in demand. That's it. If we don't, we are strapping small, weak wings to our airplane and tht will lead to a crash. 
If not, streamline your product offering so you aren't wasting precious overhead and energy pushing products that do not support the lift of the aircraft. 

Day 24: Prioritize Marketing

If you don't attract people to the thing you've built, they won't come. 
Testing your marketing language is like testing an engine before your connect it to the body of the plane. Most businesses will wiat until the last minute to prepate their marketing ideas because their energy is being use to create the product/ But without the right marketing language and plan, nobody will be attracted to the product after it gets built. So why not test the engine first?
...there are times that orders are so low, refuns must be given and the product launch should be cancelled; otherwise you risk crahsing the airplane. 

Day 25: Run A Sales System

Create a step-by-step path your customers can take to make a purchase, and monitor the progres of every lead. 
Monthly and weekly goals should be established that motivate sales professionals to guide more customers down the path. 
Every sales team needs a series a steps to take a qualifies lead down in order to close the deal. 
...the point is to predetermine the path you want to take customers down and be able to count the number of leads at each stage of the path. 

Day 26: Protect Cash Flow

You can have a prefectly sound airplane with giant, strong wings, a lean, light body, and two powerful engines and yet still suffer a horrific crash if you run out of fuel. 
I call this line of thinking the "fuel filter", because every decision has to be filtered through the questions "how will this affect cash?"

Chapter 5: How (and Why) to Clarify Your Marketing Message

Because a clear message sells a product. 
That's what disciplines marketers do. They take the world through an exercise in memorization. Amatuers speak their minds. 

Day 27: Use Story to Engage Customers

The only tool known to man to spot people from daydreaming is story. 
...within minutes we have to know what the character wants. 
We've got to define some kind of problem the character is struggling with. The problem is the key. If we don't define the problem, people will stop paying attention.
Heroes don't take action unless they are challenged by the guide to do so. 
The story teller must paint a picture of what life looks like if everything goes well. 
...happen to our hero, the storyu is dull and boring. Something must be potentially won or lost or the story won't engage the audience. 

Day 28: Position Your Customer as the Hero

Why? Because customer are looking for a guide who can help them win the day. They aren't looking for another hero. 
Guides are the strongest characters in the story because they have already overcome the very same challenges the hero must now overcome. That means they are experiences and equipped and know how to win.
...a brand, product, or leader positions itself as thehero and not the guide, customers will often look past it for another brand, leader or product. 
A hero tells their own story while a guide understands the hero storya nd sacrifices to help them win. 
The one-two punch in communication as a professional is to say I know what you're struggling with and I can help you get out of it. 

Day 29: Talk About Your Customers Problem

Until you start talking about your product or your brand as the solution to sombebody's problem, they won't be interested. 
The problem is the hook.
It means that we have to keep talking about our customers' problems or they won't be interested in our products. 
But these are wasted words. The very first thing a professional should talk about is the problem they or their product can solve. 

Day 30: Create a Clear Call to Action

In a good story, the guide must confidently ask the hero to take action or the hero will lose confidence and fail. 
Why? Because when a guide fails to confidently ask people to take action, the listener begins to doubt the guide's competence. Can you or can't you get the hero out of this predicament. 
Audiences can smell whether or not you believe in your ideas or your products. Either you have a solution or you do not. You can either help in their journey or you cannot. If you cannot, you will politely ask them to buy your product in such a way that you sound like you're asking for charity (because you are). If you can help them, though, you will tell them to buy your product or use your service because your no longer want them to struggle with their problem. 
Here was the real point I wanted my class to understand: If you do not tell people what to do, they will not do anything. If you don't end a speach with a clear call to action, people will not take action. If your do not give people a step-by-step instructions on your website, they will not take a step at all. 

Day 31: Define the Stakes and Create Urgency

...define what's at stake if the audience chooses somebody else over you. 
If you don't define what's at stake, you will fade from memory faster than one of those black-and-white German films that chooses to be artful rather than interesting. 
If there are no stakes, there is no story. 
Define that's at stake and your story will get very very interesting. 

Tip of the Day: When clarifying your marketing message, define what can be won or lost if people don't engage in the story you're inviting them into. 

Chapter 6: Marketing Made Easy
How to Create a Sales Funnel That Converts Potentials Customers into Buyers

Introduction
The reason they were able to survive is because businesses who built sales funnels had collected email addresses and contact information. They were then able to pivot thier message and their offerings to reflect the crisis. Businesses who didn't have sales funnels were not able to reach out to their customers and so were forgotten. 
Everybody should understand how to tell people what they do and why it matters. 

Day 32: Understand a Sales Funnel

All sales are relational. 
...unless they hear about products or services from people or brands they trust. 
...they are either curious to know more about us or they are not. 
Figure 6.1
Curiosity
Enlightenment 
Commitment 

Whether people are curious about your or your brand depends on whether they can associate you with their survivival. 
Enlightening a customer about how your product can help them survive simply means telling them how. How does this product work to help me survive?
Only after a person is enlightened and convinced their problem can be solved and their servival will be enhanced are they willing to move into the next stage of a relationship commitment. 
A commitment happens in a relationship when a person is willing to take a risk on another person or a product they beleive will help them survive. 
If we ask for a commitment before we pique somebody's curiosity or enlighten them about our product, they will walk away.

Day 33: Write a One-Liner That Generates Sales

When most people are asked what they do, they state the name of the company they work for or perhaps their job title. This information fails to pique anybody's curiosity.
1. A problem
2. Your product as a solution
3. The result

Once you've created your one-liner, print it on the back of your business card. Use your one-liner as your email signature. Make sure to include your one-liner on your website. Memorize your one-liner, so that when people ask you what you do, you give a clear answer that grows your business. 

Day 34: Wire-Frame an Effective Website

Most people do not read websites, they scan them. 
In only five seconds, would the caveman be able to clearly state the answer to these three questions:
1. What do you offer?
2. How will it make my life better?
3. What do I need to do to buy it?

Most companies want to share for too much information on ther website.
What they do need to know is what you offer, how it will make their lives better,  and what they need to do to buy it. 
The top section of your website is most important because it frames the rest of the message...

Day 35: Collect Email Addresses

The key is to offer tangible, free value in exchange for a potential customer's contact information. 
...they are only willing to give up their emial address for something they would actually pay ten or twenty dollars for. 
You've likely tried to collect email addresses in the past by starting a newsletter, but nobody wants to subscribe to your newsletter. Why? Because they don't know what specific problem your newsletter solves. A PDF entitled "How To Get Your Dog To Stop Jumping On People," on the other hand, offers clear value. 
1. Make it short
2. Give it a cover
3. Make it solve a specific problem

Day36: Email Your Customers

I wanted and had a strong bias toward actions. But that wasn't going to work with her. What she wanted was for me to hang out long enough and in a variety of situations so that any weirdness would come out and she'd know what she was getting. Smart women. 

Creating an email campaign gives you the chance to spend quality time with your customers.
You should continue to solve their problems, encourage them, inspire and inform them. 
Asking a customer for a commitment is a big deal. They could easility lose thier money or even feel like a fool for making the wrong decision. 

Chapter 7 Intro: Communication Made Simple - How to Become An Exceptional Communicator

To give a good presentation, we need to understand the five questions every audience secretly wants the presenter to answer. 
If you do answer them, you answer them creatively and memorabl, the audience will like your presention. 
1. What problem are you going to help the audience solve?
2. What is your solution to the problem?
3. What will my life look like if I take your up on your solution?
4. What do you want to audience to do next?
5. What do you wnat the audience to remember?

Many communication coaches will tell you to open with a joke or be vulnerable or breathe deeply before you start talking. All of that advice is fine, but none of it is necessary  to give a great presentation. What's necessary for any presentation whether you're funny or smart or vulnerable or witty, is to answer those five questions for tha audience. If you answer those questions, you will win. 


Day 38: Give a Great Presentation

Instead of opening with an introduction, open with the problem. 
Because why should I assume anyone cares who I am until they know I can solve an important problem?
When you open a presentation by talking about a problem, you hook the audience. When you don't open with a problem, the audience sits and wonders why they should be listening. 

Day 39: Foreshadow a Climactic Scene

A good story is always headed somehwere, and usually that somewhere has been foreshadowed early...
What will life look like if people actually do what your presenation is asking them to do? Have you painted a picture so the audience can imagine that better life?
Be sure to make your foreshadowed climactic scene visual. The harder the climactic scene is to visualize, the less power it will have to engage your audience. 
When you foreshadow a climactic scene in your presentation, you inspire your audience to head toward that scene. The idea is to make the audience want to make the scene come to life. 

Day 40: Challenging the Audience to Take Action

A great communicator will include a strong call to action in thier presentation so the audience can knowingly contribute to the meaningful effort they recommend. 
...in general, people do not take action unless they are challenged to take action. 
In stories, heroes must be forced to take action by some kind of inciting incident.
...when you ask an audience to sacrifice on behalf of an idea or a plan, they begin to own that idea or plan for themselves. 
It must be clear.
...don't make people figure out what you want them to do. Just tell them. And tell them plainly. 

Day 41: Determine the Theme of Your Presentation

"People remember the last thing you say more than anything else" he said. "It's like ringing a bell. It just keeps reververating in their minds for an hour or more."
The most powerful last tine of your presentation should be the theme of your talk. 
A theme is a way of saying what the story is about or the moral of the story. 
To discover your theme, ask yourself why this presentation is so important. 
Starting the theme at the end of your presentation makes sure you told your audience what your talk was about. Without stating the theme, your are making your audience do the math to figure it out for themselves. Chances are, unless you state your theme, they won't be able to figure out the main idea of your talk. And that means you won't be remembered as a good presenter. 
Sadly, most audiences have no idea what the presenter was trying to day. They just laughed at a few jokes and sighed at a few emotional stories. And then forgot everything. 
In fact, I will often repeat the theme several times throughout myu talk, being careful, of course, to state it clearly again at the end of my talk. 

Day 42: Qaulify the Lead

When selling, you are inviting a character into a story in which their problem gets solved and they are transformed into a better, more fully equipped version of themselves. This means, however, that not every character is right for the part. 
Does the customer have the problem the product solves?
Can the customer afford to buy the solution?
Does the customer have the authority to buy the product?
...if you cast the wrong characters, the story won't work.
You'll have to fully understand what problem your product actually solves and develop a series of questions to access whether or not your lead has that problem.
Every salesperson should keep a long list of qualified leads. Each of these leads is a candidate to be cast in the story you are inviting them into. 

Day 43: Invite Customers into a Story

Now that you know who to cast in the story, it's time to invite them into the story itself. 
1. I see you are struggling with X problem
2. I see that X problem is causing Y frustrtion
3. Our product or service resolves Y frustration by resolving X problem
4. We've worked with hundreds of clients with X problems and here are the results
5. Let's create a step-by-step plan so your problem and frustration get resolved
...you should use this formula to invite customers into a storyin which their problems are resolved through the purchasing of your products.
...do the hard work of identifying their problems, listening to their frustrations that their problems are causing, and consulting with them over how those problems can be solved.
    When you talk with a potential customer, do you cleary see and can you cleary explain the story you are inviting them into? And can you customize that story for their specific situation and pain points? And are you       communicating that story as an invitation to solve their problems and change their lives?
...use the five-part formula above to map your customers' stories and then start inviting them to resolve their problem.

Day 44: Repeat Your Talking Points

You are a guide for your customers. 
So, what does a guide do well? Well, as it relates to selling, a guide does three things:
1. Reminds the hero what the story is about
2. Gives the hero a plan to resolve thier problem and win the day
3. Foreshadows the climiactic scene of the story

The guide needs to know their lines and speak them often. Reminding the customer about the story and offering them a plan comes down to talking points.
The key to inviting customers into a story is to figure out the talking points that define the story and then repeat them in lunch meetings, emials, proposals, phone calls, and more. 
...80 percent of your time can be spent building authentic relationship as long as 20 percent of your communication is reinforcing the talking points and inviting the customer into a clear and compelling story.
