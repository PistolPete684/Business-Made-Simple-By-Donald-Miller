# Business-Made-Simple-By-Donald-Miller
Chapter highlights

Chapter One - Character 

Day 1: See yourself as an economic product on the open market

"This means when you are chosen to take a position at a company, your boss is literally betting their own career and livelihood on your performance."
"The key to moving ahead is to become the very best investment possible."
"Everybody chases a good investment and divests themselves of bad investments. Consider that a natural law."
"If you are an investment that gets a return, you will attract business, responsibilities, and greter compensation."
"Successful business leaders conduct their lives so they are terrific financial investments. You should conduct your life that way too."

Day 2: See yourself as a hero, not a victim.

Day 3: Know how to de-escalate drama.

"Dramatic peopler, however, steal your energy so you don't have anything left to take care of yourself or others."
"We respect people who react a little under, not over, the lever of drama a situation deserves. We trust people who can remain calmand de-escalate drama so that crucial energy needed to deal with a truly important situation is not wasted."
"When tasked with something monumental, being a dramatic person will not serve your interests."

Day 4: Accept Feedback as a Gift

"Many of the worl's most successful people have established a routine in which they get feedback from their peers."
To establish a feeback loop in your life, consider these ideas:
"1. Choose people who have your best interest at heart."
"2. Schedule meetings in a repeting routine-every quarter or every month."
"3. Establish a routine set of questions."
"Have you seen me act unprofessionally?"
"Have you noticed that I've been missing something?"
"What am I doing that I can improve upon?"
"Very few people have the ability to hear and accept feedback."

Day 5: Know the Right Way to Engage in Conflict

"Conflict avoidant people are rarely chosen to lead."
"You cannot climb a mountain, build a bridge, create a community, or grow a business without engaging in and navigating conflict."
"...conflict and success go hand in hand. If you avoid conflict, your will not achieve success."

Day 6: Long to be Trusted and Respected More Than Liked

"What team members want most is clarity."
"Many new managers are confused at how relationships with peers change when they are chosen to lead."
"When you ask a team member what their boss expects of them, the team member should know;..."
"Let them know and keep them accountable in a daily stand up meeting."
"Do not put your team in the mind reading business. Even if they clearly meet your expectations, they won't beleive it until you tell them."

Day 7: Have a Bias toward Action

"...becoming successful is more about fully being yourself than it is about any kind of formula."
"That said, there is one thing every successful person has in common: They have a bias toward action."
"getting the ball in the end zone"
:We say this because we know drawing up plays, giving pep talks, and even the hard work of driving the ball down the field does not produce points. The only thing that produces points is putting the ball in the end zone."
"In fact, it's surprising to me how many successful people I've met who I did not find to be especialy intelligent. That is, as I've talked with them, I realised they were not well read or imaginative. And as I've wondered how such simple thinkers could end up with so much influence and money, I've realised it'vs because their incredibly strong bias towards action."
"...know that you can beat just about anybody in the marketplace as long as you wake up everyday and take action."

Day 8: Do Not Choose to Be Confused

"What masquerades as confusion is often our desire to avoid conflict and out unwillingness to take action."
"We just don't want to do the thing we need to do, and so we choose confusion to avoid responsibility."
"It helps me in times of confusion to actually name what it is that is making us confused."

Day 9" Be Relentlessly Optimistic

Day 10: Have a Growth Mindset

Why do they become defensive? Because they do not beleive they can learn to do better.
In short, having a growth mindset is about understanding that we will never reach the top of the mountain but we can keep climbing so the view gets better and better. 

Chapter 2: Leadership Made Simple

The number one job of a leader is to wake up every morning, point to the horizon , and let everybody on the team know where the organization is going.
Great leaders become great because their mission makes them great.
A leader who can help a team define a mission and who can remind that team daily of what the mission is and why it matters is a valuable gift to their organization. 

Day 11: Write a Good Mission Statement

To lead yourself of a team, you have to know where you're going. 
A good mission statement is short, interesting and inspirational. Otherwise, it's worthless. 
It should explain what you are doing to serve people and why that effort matters.
People are attracted to a mission. They aren't attracted to business jargon.
Here is a formula for a good mission statement: We will accomplish _____ by _____ because of _____ .
The reality is, if we or our team cannot recite our mission statement, we are not on a mission.

Day 12: Define Key Characteristics

When I say inspirational, I mean they don't have to be characteristics you currently embody. They can be characteristics they demand improvement and change. And when I say instructive, What I mena is they should be immediatley actionable when sombody hears them. 
When you define the key characteristics your team needs to develop, you're defining the kinds of people who are aloud to work for you. 
Defining key characteristics helps you know which people to hire and which people to dismiss. If you fail to define the key characteristics required to accomplish yourmission, your will likley have the wrong people on your team. 
What sort of characteristics is it important for you and your team members to have in order to accomplish your mission?

Day 13: Determine Critical Actions
But unless characters in stories do something, the mission will never be accomplished. 
...but by defining three critical actions everyone of you can take, ou create a sense of alignment you wouldn't otherwise have. 
...you collect and focus energy toward the accomplishment of your mission. 
Those three critical actions establish a way of life

Day 14: Tell a Great Story

Telling the story of your company or project is important because in telling your story your attract resources. When you tell your story, people decide whether or not to buy from you, or even spread the word about what you're doing. 
Often, they make the mistake of telling their history. 
But your history is not your story. Your story is different. Your story is way of explaining what you do that engaged people and makes them want to join. Your history, on the other hand, is just a bunch of things that has happened in your past. 
In the most simple form a story structure, a story features a character who has been destabilized by an event ands then overcomes a series of challenges to restabilize their life.
We started with a problem, made the problem worse, positioned the product as the resolution to the problem, and then described a happier life because the problem has been solved. 
Telling stories isn't hard. It just takes a little knowledge and then the discipline to stay on message. 
What problem does your company solve? How is that problem making people feel? How is your product positioned to solve that problem? And after the problem is solved, what do people lives look like?
...make sure each team member knows how to tell the story...

Day 15: Define Your Theme and Your "Why"

How do we convince people our mission matters? We do this by defining a theme. 
When a writer defines a themes,  their story gets more meaningful and more clear. If we want our mission to be meaningful and clear, we must have a theme. 
When you define your theme, you and everyone else will know why your mission matters.
...add the word 'because' at the end of your mission statement, and then finish the sentence. 
Knowing your theme becomes important because it is the critical soud bite that answers the question why.
Your theme is your purpose, and people need a purpose to passionately engage in their work. 

Chapter 3: Productivity Made Simple

Many professionals work hard but get little done. Their frantic activity only serves to move them around in circles. There is one reason for this and its that their life lacks focus. 
...human being's life has the most menaing when they live it as though they are a hero on a mission.
A hero on a mission lives with a purpose and intention. They do not waste their time because their time is important. A hero on a mission knows how to manage their time so they do not feel anxious but are focused, motivated, and inspired to do the work that matters. 
If we don't establish priorities and healthy routines, telivision, news, food, achohol, and bad company are more than willing to occupy our time. Plenty of peple make plenty of money by keeping us distracted. But their distractions profit you nothing. 
...learn a daily routine that increases your output without increasing your anxiety.

Day 16: Make Wise Daily Decisions

If this were the second time I were living this day, what would I do differently?
Pretend this is the second time you lived this day and don't make the same mistakes.
...we need to live in such a way that we don't have regret. 
It's by reflecting that we edit our actions and design our lives. 
Are you desinging your life, or is somebody else designing it for you?

Day 17: Prioritize Your Primary Tasks

What's the most important thing you can do today?
...not every unit of work gets the same return.
...two task lists each day...
... three items are the most important tasks for the success of your important objectives. 
The other task list will be the odds and ends that need to be accomplished. 
Most of my prioritized tasks are small parts of much larger projects. 
When working on enormous projects that we cannot finish in a short period of time, we are especially suseptible to short-term wins. I'd much rather return 10 emails than write ten paragraphs in a book because each email makes me feel like I've accomplished something while those ten paragraphs feel like a drop in the bucket. 
...urgent distractions...
Every day, we must know what our three highest return opportunitiesa are, or else low opportuntiy returns will feel more important. 
Any work that moves us closer to our objectives is a high-return opportunity, and any work that does not is not. 
Prioritize those taks, day after day, and you will move closer to your goals without falling into the trap of "urgent distractions".

Day 18: Maximize Your "Power Hours"

The mental energy you have in the morning is stronger and more alert then the energy you'll have after lunch.
...if you block time for your important project in the morning, you'll get to spend the rest of the day knowing you've already completed the important tasks. 
Most value-driven professionals get their important work done in the mornings. 

Day 19: Say "No" to Distractions

They've said yes to so many things tht they've become confused about what their story is about. 
Heroes on a mission, however, are focused. 
There are friends who want to get together and opportunities that, while not in line with our goals, are truly exciting. 
But what if we say yes to too many thing, we are saying no to the deep and focused attention it takes to do a few things well. 
Few people realize that one of the keys to Stephen King's success is his disciplined ability to reject distracting opportunities in exchange for accomplishing his priorities.
If we don't know what our priorities are, we will say yes to everything and delude our stories so much that our lives and work no longer make sense. 
What are you saying no to in order to say yes to a focused and meaningful life?

Day 20: Block Your Time and Get More Done:

Time is worth much more than money.
Sadly, most people don't give much thought to managing their time. That doesn't mena their time isn't managed.
We would never let other people manage the money in our wallet, so why would we let other people manage out time-which, as pointed out, is worth so much more than money.
Blocking periods of time in which you cannot be distracted is the equivalent of getting into the fast lane and pressing the gas pedal.
Your entire career is based on increasing output as it relates to your activity. A value-driven professional can get twice as much done in the same period of time as a professional who does not use time strategically.
Blocking my time in advance allows me to say no to distractions because, well, I'm already booked. 
The idea is to create a rhythm of productivity.
What important tasks do you need to do each week?Consider assigning those taks to a specific block of time you decide in advance. 
...block personal time so you don't accidentally book a business meeting during the time block yuou've allotted for friends and family. 

Chapter 4: How a Business Really Works and How to Keep It From Crashing

Day 22: Keep Your Overhead Down

And cash flow seems to always hit zero suddenly. Nobody seems to see it coming. 
Overhead is anyting involved in the cost of doing business tht is not releated to product creation, marketing, or sales. 
Unless money is spent in the direct effort to make more money, that expenditure should be questioned. This is the key to keeping overhead in check. 
Categorize your expenses into four major categories: product creation, sales, marketing and overhead. 

Day 23: Mane and Sell the Right Products

They are light. They can be sold for considerable profit or a smaller profit but at volume.
They are strong. There is a strong demand for the product in the marketplace.
...we wil only invest in products that are profitable and in demand. That's it. If we don't, we are strapping small, weak wings to our airplane and tht will lead to a crash. 
If not, streamline your product offering so you aren't wasting precious overhead and energy pushing products that do not support the lift of the aircraft. 

Day 24: Prioritize Marketing

If you don't attract people to the thing you've built, they won't come. 
Testing your marketing language is like testing an engine before your connect it to the body of the plane. Most businesses will wiat until the last minute to prepate their marketing ideas because their energy is being use to create the product/ But without the right marketing language and plan, nobody will be attracted to the product after it gets built. So why not test the engine first?
...there are times that orders are so low, refuns must be given and the product launch should be cancelled; otherwise you risk crahsing the airplane. 

Day 25: Run A Sales System

Create a step-by-step path your customers can take to make a purchase, and monitor the progres of every lead. 
Monthly and weekly goals should be established that motivate sales professionals to guide more customers down the path. 
Every sales team needs a series a steps to take a qualifies lead down in order to close the deal. 
...the point is to predetermine the path you want to take customers down and be able to count the number of leads at each stage of the path. 

Day 26: Protect Cash Flow

You can have a prefectly sound airplane with giant, strong wings, a lean, light body, and two powerful engines and yet still suffer a horrific crash if you run out of fuel. 
I call this line of thinking the "fuel filter", because every decision has to be filtered through the questions "how will this affect cash?"

Chapter 5: How (and Why) to Clarify Your Marketing Message

Because a clear message sells a product. 
That's what disciplines marketers do. They take the world through an exercise in memorization. Amatuers speak their minds. 

Day 27: Use Story to Engage Customers

The only tool known to man to spot people from daydreaming is story. 
...within minutes we have to know what the character wants. 
We've got to define some kind of problem the character is struggling with. The problem is the key. If we don't define the problem, people will stop paying attention.
Heroes don't take action unless they are challenged by the guide to do so. 
The story teller must paint a picture of what life looks like if everything goes well. 
...happen to our hero, the storyu is dull and boring. Something must be potentially won or lost or the story won't engage the audience.
